        1. At present, Adani operates more than 45 Berths PAN India and approximately 4000 Vessels calling at our Port. 2. The vessel agents share the ETA by which Port Authorities manage the resource and estimates the TAT. 3. Vessel TAT are dependent on various Factors like the productivity, resource allocated, Tide etc. 4. The solution should be such that the Port Authorities are able to effectively predict the Optimum TAT which yields maximum revenue by clearly optimizing the resources used. Relooking at the problem: 1. Can out Current Terminal Operating system (TOS) predict using the available data points? 2. Do we require an analytical engine to run algorithms? 3. Will Live Dashboard help to control & monitor the Vessel Operation? 4. Say our current prediction is 70% accurate we would definitely want to increase the prediction accuracy by 10%. 5. Can ML be implemented such that the same vessel calling at our port month after month the prediction is actually very accurate? 6. All vessel related information, resources & Tariff for maximum revenue will be provided. Connections to our DB and Data warehouse access are possible. If we look at the entire process: 1. Vessel agent submits the ETA 2. Port Authority does the berth and resource planning. 3. Operations are undertaken. 4. Changes in Planned TAT. 5. Revision in TAT 6. Other Vessels incoming are affected by such changes in TAT. 7. New TAT Prediction for other incoming vessels.

        Search and Rescue (SAR) is an operation to find and rescue the people in distress. SAR operations aim at finding missing objects with minimum time in a determined area. There are fundamentally two problems in these operations. The first problem is assessing highly reliable probability distribution maps, and the second is determining the search pattern that sweeps the area from the air as fast as possible. SAR operations benefit greatly from the GIS technology. The area, determined by the search planner, that is to be searched is called Search Area. This area may be sub-divided into search sub-areas for the purpose of assigning specific responsibilities to the available search facilities. The International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) Vol. II (ICAO DOC 9731) provides all necessary information and guidance. Projecs intends to achive: • Determining the size of the search area from the Last Known Position (LKP), including speed, heading and attitude, of aircraft. • Determining the desired area coverage • Selecting appropriate search patterns.

        An Airport Mapping Database (AMDB) is a Geographic Information System (GIS) database of an airport describing the spatial layout of the aerodrome in terms of features (e.g. runways, taxiways, and parking stands) with geometry described as points, lines or polygons and with attributes (e.g. Surface type). AMDB is intended primarily to improve the user’s situational awareness and/or to supplement surface navigation, thereby increasing safety margins and operational efficiency. AMDB represents a collection of aerodrome information that is organized and arranged for ease of electronic storage and retrieval in systems that support aerodrome surface movements, training, charting, and planning. Project intents to Create Aerodrome Maps and Charts using feature extraction from Satellite Imagery and blending that with existing Aerodrome Maps and provide an interactive 2D map containing a spatial layout of the aerodrome in terms of features (e.g. runways, taxiways, parking stands) with geometry described as points, lines or polygons, and with attributes (e.g. surface type). The aerodrome map, charts and data is available in Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP India) uploaded on website https://aim-india.aai.aero/eaip-v2-01-2019/index-en-GB.html

        Whenever a passenger enters into an airport, their credentials are checked at check in Kiosks, Entry Gates, SHA, Immigration & customs and boarding gates to validate their journey. Usually a passenger is instructed to come two hrs before for a domestic travel and four hours before an international travel. This instruction is given to passengers as their validation process might take more time than usual due to long passenger queues at each check point. The time taken by passenger to stand in a queue at a particular touch point and gets its credentials validated is called dwell time of that touch point. Hence, a mobile application based dwell time data collection and analysis at touch points of airports including check-in counters/Entry Gates/SHA/Immigration and customs/boarding gates using IOT. The Automated system needs to prompt necessary alert messages as per escalation matrix for dynamic allocation of manpower and facilities for a particular check point. What we want: • Monitoring Effective Utilization of Airport touch points • Central data base record for each dwell time data collection. • An external API integration facility to connect with existing Airport Software’s.

        Brief concept behind the problem statement - Niruha Basti (Medicated Enema) is a uniform mixture of Honey, Salt, Sneha (Oil/Ghee), Kalka (Herbal paste) and Kwatha (Herbal Decoction). The ingredients of basti dravya are to be mixed in specific order to obtain the perfect mixture. Honey and rock salt were mixed together in the beginning followed by addition of Sesame oil. This mixture was then thoroughly mixed. The finely wet grinded paste of Herbal drugs was then mixed in it thoroughly. The decoction of herbal drugs is then added to it and the mixture was subjected to thorough churning in a domestic mixer to produce a homogeneous mixture. The mixture thus produced acquires a physical state of emulsion. Solution – If there can be an AUTOMATIC BASTI BLENDER for crushing and blending basti or enema ingredients with base/bowl made of wood/metal/ceramic/granite with heavy pestle connected to machine that rotates automatically around the base at a specific speed There should be separate sections of main 5 ingredients i.e, honey, salt, oil, paste of drug and decoction of drug. The automatic blender should be pre- programmed for each ingredient to be instilled into the bowl/mortar in a specific measurable amount ( as per the percentage of each ingredient required in the final product) automatically at a specific interval with the help of a set self- timer attched into it. This will not only help making Basti/ Enema conveniently but also will prevent individual differences in final Basti by making a standard final manufactured Basti.

        Due to the pollution on the rise, food habits and hectic schedules we are getting more and more prone to health-related issues for which many a times we use antibiotics drugs. Antibiotic resistance on the rise—and predicted to kill 10 million people per year by 2050. Do think of this problem in India context, lack of knowledge, how antibiotics are prescribed, how to gather the usage of antibiotics across the country and how to mitigate the challenge. Idea would be to see what all are the most common antibiotics / salt in those drugs are being used, for what all diseases they are being prescribed for and predict what are the probable antibiotic drugs ( salts ) which would become non-effective after a certain time for curing a specific microbial infection or disease. Requirement is to build an antimicrobial stewardship platform which should be able to provide this solution.

        Problem Brief: Currently traffic police and cameras are only deployed at traffic signals. This limits them to report violations only if they happen within the vicinity leaving room for large stretches of blind spots. Another constraint is the capacity of these personnel to quickly capture as many violation’s photographs as possible towards proof before the vehicle rushes away. Vehicles to automatically identify and report traffic violations on the road around them as they move around thus acting as crowd sourced law enforcement. Solution Ask- Leverage front mounted mobile phone/dedicated cameras on car wind shield to identify, photograph and report traffic violations anywhere on the road thus reducing dependency on static cameras and human personnel.

        Problem Brief/Context - These days we are pretty habituated of home- delivery system through e-commerce platform, however there is a big dependency on delivery boys and vehicles for timely delivery of the items. We could potentially use Drones for last mile delivery of items. While current prevalent addressing mechanism such as lat/long and post code are good enough for humans, these won’t work for drone delivery as all houses in a multi-storey building will have same lat/long or post-code. Design a solution which can help drones to identify each address / flat as a separate unit and deliver the item accordingly.

        Is Traffic Jams a big problem in India? Can we think an out of the box solution to solve this and make commuting an easy accessible to everyone. Here is an opportunity for you to think Innovative and Design a “Personal Air Vehicle (PAV)” Abstract: A Personal Air Vehicle (PAV), also Personal Aerial Vehicle, is an emergent aviation market that would provide on-demand aviation services. This term was first used by NASA in 2003 when it established the Personal Air Vehicle Sector Project, as part of the Aeronautics Vehicle Systems Program. In the current situation where most of the population moving towards Metro cities, traffic management has become most critical issue. Stepping ahead from the current transport system, it is important to adopt emerging technologies for newer product innovation. Flying Vehicle or AirCAR, or Quadcopter could be ideal solution for future generation. What we are seeking is an “everyone” personal flying Vehicle, capable of being flown by ANYONE, ANYWHERE. It should be a vehicle for ALL, young and old, city-dweller. Recent advances in propulsion, energy, light-weight materials, and control and stability systems have combined to produce a moment of achievable innovation. The vehicle should function safely in both crowded cities and rural areas; it should be lightweight and manoeuvrable enough so that anyone can move it around. Digital Design Output: Design a PAV using Autodesk Fusion 360 Software (Free for education & Students) system to enable movement of such vehicles safely in the air traffic by allocating paths, height. The system should additionally provide methods to raise and manage SOS calls. The Design should pass through all the below mentioned phases - Ideation/Conceptualization- Freeform digital modelling - Modelling/Designing- 3D solid Digital model on Fusion 360 - Simulation and Analysis- should be capable to carry 2 person which is 120 Kg min - Rendering and Animation- Apply colour, lights, background to share aesthetic image of your model.

        Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) is the use of software and computer-controlled machinery to automate a manufacturing process. Based on that definition, you need three components for a CAM system to function: Software that tells a machine how to make a product by generating toolpaths. Machinery that can turn raw material into a finished product. Post Processing that converts toolpaths into a language machines can understand. From high-efficiency roughing with Adaptive Clearing to simplified control of multi-axis machines with Tool Orientation, Autodesk Fusion 360 makes it easy to program your CNC machine, fast. Manufacture with 2.5, 3, 4, and 5-axis milling, probing, turning, mill-turning, and profiling operations paired with a powerful post engine all included alongside professional design tools. Students are supposed to use Fusion 360 Software to generate NC code with machine details & tool library. Mentor will help to manufacture the metal component using CNC machine & NC code generated by participants.

        Insurance has typically been a push product where the customer is usually sold an insurance by the agents. This makes the product marketing/ sales cost too high due to low conversion rates on insurance sales. It can be said that two factors contribute to this: 1. Insurance being viewed as an expense rather than a protection 2. The long and non-engaging information capture process which is required to issue the insurance. At Bajaj, we are looking to solve this problem by providing a mobile app as an engagement tool, which also helps you manage your health better. This app will also act as a source for insurance sales basis the data provided by the consumer. Gamification has emerged as a tool in the financial industry to convert the existing processes (non- engaging) into exciting activities. Some examples of the same can be capturing relevant information through quizzes (on say, world heart day) or health score generators (answer these questions to get your health score/ heart age).
